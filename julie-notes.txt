TODOS: 

- [ ] add password strength (min. 5 character with letters & numbers & username format (length & allowed characters))
- [ ] add a print and a share link buttons on top right
- [ ] settings button to edit Profile and info
- [ ] fix/change footer (styling & content)
- [ ] make the edit Courses button only show if the current_user_id matches the user for the page (figure out a way to show the link with courses for everyone [maybe route of page/courses/username])
- [ ] ...then change the routes/flux for add/edit/delete so that you don't need any authentication (since the edit button will only show if you are signed in and the user for the course page)

- [ ] for the date part, make sure that you're not allowed to put in year past 9999 (date bug)
- [ ] make the courses sortable by expected start date, start date, due date, by course number, course number, maybe a custom option so the users can move it around as needed
- [ ] when editing or adding a new course finishes, I want the page to go back to the top of the screen possibly
- [ ] courseTracker.js: In the other details input, put some margin/padding below the flating label (or padding top to the actual value)
- [ ] add an option to see the details
- [ ] add a habit tracker page/project tracker/cert tracker as well maybe?
- [ ] minimize, pop out FORM (new browser/tab option that still sends the requests) (keep in mind
you'll probably have to export/import Modal for the course/project form)
- [ ] edit courses button only showing if you are the user.
(anyone with the link should be able to see the front end page)
- [ ] makes you turn the addBlock off and refresh to see the page (put little adds - not too much)
- [ ] add an expires_date (course and/or certs)

TODOS:
- [ ] Redesign the signup/login/forgot password
- [ ] Create a contact us
- [ ] Instead of sending jwt token to edit to match the user - change the logic so you can only see the edit mode, if the user_id matches?? (then you would need to adjust the logic to the flux and routes as well but the code would be simpler... just a thought...)

- [ ] add a image field (using cloudinary) (maybe a button you hover over: once you hoverd, you see an img link that opens in a new tab &/or the description showing (that you could copy & paste as well))
- [ ] add an other field (for link to cert or something along those lines - maybe check LinkedIn for ideas?)
- [ ] add a little button on the Course so that if you hover over it, you can see the details (and or a modal) for the course

- [ ] be able to duplicate a course into a new one before hitting the add course button (will have to add the course after being duplicated)
- [ ] be able to radio check what you what to see 
or...
- [ ] when is_finished, it shows started & finished but when it's not, it shows expected_start_date, (start_date), due date


- [ ] bug checks: max characters check/alerts
- [ ] I want to see the eyeballs even when the field/input is active


-------- brain storming --------
* have them also sign in with a unique username (required)
    * then attach a username with (user) with the courses & certifications

    * they can also sign in with their username &/or email

    * then the link will always work like this
        *hosting.com/course-tracker/username
        or
        *hosting.com/cert-tracker/username

* You will only be able to see the edit courses button if the logged in user_id matches the user_id of the courses

-------- installs needed ----------
* npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
