TODOS: 
- [ ] BUGFIX: when trying to add this info - I'm getting a 500 error (i'm guessing too many char for the course # - but I'm not seeing any errors pop up so I can't tell what issue it is - make sure the error message is showing)
* COURSE NUMBER: MEDCERTS: CERTIFICATION PATHWAY

- [ ] When clicking the edit button, I want it to take me to the top of the page.

- [ ] Make the admin: course tracker & admin: certifications tracker available to admin only - figure out a creative way or only logged in under my email or admin email
- [ ] Add cloudinary to upload cert images
- [ ] Add a button that takes you to a different link for each certification (link that takes you to a online cert page such as: https://certificate.4geeks.com/2de00efc80a1d717038b059d9d32600378ba9ec1)
- [ ] share button so it shares a shareable link to this page that others can see but not edit
- [ ] Maybe a see my resume circle button attached option to each of the pages (when you click on it, the resume pops up as a modal - that you may download and/or search through)

- [ ] make sure you can't clikc and drag order when it's not in edit mode
- [ ] in detail notes pop up, make sure x-axis scroll is off/disabled
- [ ] when you click on the edit btn the form should not be unexpanded (make sure it's expanded)
- [ ] add password strength (min. 5 character with letters & numbers & username format (length & allowed characters))
- [ ] add errors for adding (such as max characters)
- [ ] make placeholders grey
- [ ] fix the ADMIN pages so that it shows the user and then their courses/certifications separately as a card li
- [ ] universal time is making it harder to understand (keep it universal in the db and local time on front end for dates)
- [ ] make course number to 35 max characters
- [ ] add a print and a share link buttons on top right
- [ ] settings button to edit Profile and info
- [ ] fix/change footer (styling & content)

- [ ] make the courses sortable by expected start date, start date, due date, by course number, course number, maybe a custom option so the users can move it around as needed
- [ ] when editing or adding a new course finishes, I want the page to go back to the top of the screen possibly
- [ ] courseTracker.js: In the other details input, put some margin/padding below the flating label (or padding top to the actual value)
- [ ] add an option to see the details
- [ ] add a habit tracker page/project tracker/cert tracker as well maybe?
- [ ] minimize, pop out FORM (new browser/tab option that still sends the requests) (keep in mind
you'll probably have to export/import Modal for the course/project form)
- [ ] edit courses button only showing if you are the user.
(anyone with the link should be able to see the front end page)
- [ ] makes you turn the addBlock off and refresh to see the page (put little adds - not too much)
- [ ] add an expires_date (course and/or certs)

TODOS:
- [ ] Redesign the signup/login/forgot password
- [ ] Create a contact us
- [ ] Instead of sending jwt token to edit to match the user - change the logic so you can only see the edit mode, if the user_id matches?? (then you would need to adjust the logic to the flux and routes as well but the code would be simpler... just a thought...)

- [ ] add a image field (using cloudinary) (maybe a button you hover over: once you hoverd, you see an img link that opens in a new tab &/or the description showing (that you could copy & paste as well))
- [ ] add an other field (for link to cert or something along those lines - maybe check LinkedIn for ideas?)
- [ ] add a little button on the Course so that if you hover over it, you can see the details (and or a modal) for the course

- [ ] be able to duplicate a course into a new one before hitting the add course button (will have to add the course after being duplicated)
- [ ] be able to radio check what you what to see 
or...
- [ ] when is_finished, it shows started & finished but when it's not, it shows expected_start_date, (start_date), due date


- [ ] bug checks: max characters check/alerts
- [ ] I want to see the eyeballs even when the field/input is active


-------- brain storming --------
* have them also sign in with a unique username (required)
    * then attach a username with (user) with the courses & certifications

    * they can also sign in with their username &/or email

    * then the link will always work like this
        *hosting.com/course-tracker/username
        or
        *hosting.com/cert-tracker/username


-------- notes --------
* link for cert-tracker img: https://www.greentrainingusa.com/media/icons/medium/cert-tracker.jpg

* You will only be able to see the edit courses button if the logged in user_id matches the user_id of the courses

-------- installs needed ----------
* npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
* npm install react-icons --save
* npm install react-bootstrap
